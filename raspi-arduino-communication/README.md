# RasPi Arduino Communication

## Description
In this project Raspberry Pi controls LEDs connected to Arduino. Communication is organized over serial port. On the Raspberry Pi side there is either python scrip running that sends randomly which LED shouldbe toggled, or a simple HTTP server that can be accessed from a local network and controls which LED should be toggled.
